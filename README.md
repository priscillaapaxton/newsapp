### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
NewsApp connects users to recently published previews of Wall Street Journal news articles. If the user is interrested in reading an article they see, they can easily navigate to the actual article within the application

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This project was completed over sevral days in a total of 8 hours

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their LinkedIn.)
- [Priscilla Paxton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priscilla-paxton-9175bb199/)


### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> 
This project was intended to simulate a take home tech challenge as part of an interview

### Architecture:
The application fetches all news articles and then stores them within the state. An individual article can be viewed using properties of it's url to locate it within the array of articles.

### Future Iterations
Future work on this would include: consistent UI (search bar always staying hidden when an article is being viewed), sad path/error handling, testing, and more engaging UI
